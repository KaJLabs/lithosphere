# Glossary

Key terms and definitions used throughout the Lithosphere documentation.

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **BFT** | Byzantine Fault-Tolerant. A consensus algorithm that guarantees safety for up to a third of Byzantine (malicious) actors. |
| **Blockchain** | A growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked together using cryptography. |
| **BSC** | Binance Smart Chain. |
| **Burn** | A process by which digital currency miners and developers can remove tokens or coins from circulation. |
| **CometBFT** | The consensus engine (formerly Tendermint Core) used by Cosmos SDK-based chains including Lithosphere. |
| **Cosmovisor** | A process manager for Cosmos SDK-based blockchains that handles binary upgrades with minimal downtime. |
| **Cross Chain** | The interoperability between two relatively independent blockchains. |
| **DApps** | Decentralized Applications -- digital applications that run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer network of computers instead of a single computer. |
| **DeFi** | Decentralized Finance -- financial applications built on blockchain technology without centralized intermediaries. |
| **DEX** | Decentralized Exchange. |
| **DKG** | Distributed Key Generation -- a cryptographic protocol where multiple parties jointly generate a key pair without any single party learning the full private key. |
| **DNN** | Deep Neural Network -- used in Lithosphere to make smart contracts intelligent. |
| **ECDSA** | Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm -- the signature algorithm used by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and supported by MDKM. |
| **ERC** | Ethereum Request for Comments -- a standard for token contracts on Ethereum. |
| **EVM** | Ethereum Virtual Machine -- a computation engine that acts like a decentralized computer. Lithosphere is EVM-compatible. |
| **Interoperability** | The ability of computer systems or software to exchange and make use of information. |
| **LAX** | Lithosphere Algorithmic Cryptocurrency -- an algorithmic stablecoin in the Lithosphere ecosystem. |
| **LEP100** | Lithosphere Evolution Proposal 100 -- the multi-chain token standard for the Lithosphere network. |
| **LinBFT** | Linear-communication BFT Protocol -- Lithosphere's consensus algorithm proposed by Dr. David Yang. |
| **LITHO** | The native token of the Lithosphere network, used for transaction fees, staking, and governance. |
| **LithoSwap** | Lithosphere's cross-chain decentralized exchange with NFT exchange support. |
| **LithoVM** | Lithosphere's EVM-compatible virtual machine runtime. |
| **Lock-in** | The process of establishing distributed control over a digital asset from another blockchain via MDKM. |
| **Lock-out** | The reversal of Lock-in, returning control of a digital asset to its owner. |
| **MDKM** | Myriad Distributed Key Management -- Lithosphere's system for distributed control and management of accounts and assets across blockchains. |
| **NFT** | Non-Fungible Token -- a unit of data stored on a blockchain that certifies a unique digital asset. |
| **Pegged Coins** | LEP100 tokens pegged to external assets (e.g., BTCL is BTC pegged to LEP100). |
| **PoS** | Proof of Stake -- a consensus mechanism where validators stake tokens to participate in block production. |
| **Ring Signature** | A cryptographic signature scheme that provides anonymity by combining the transaction sender with a group of decoy signers. |
| **Threshold Signature** | A signature scheme requiring a minimum number (k) of participants out of a total (n) to produce a valid signature. |
| **Time Slicing** | A LEP100 feature that adds start and end time attributes to tokens, enabling time-limited token utility. |
| **Token** | A set of rules encoded in smart contracts. Each token belongs to a blockchain address and represents a digital asset stored on the blockchain. |
| **Traction** | Drawing or pulling rate in a business context. |
| **Usufruct** | The right to use and derive benefit from a digital asset without holding ownership, enabled by Lithosphere smart contracts. |
| **Validator** | A node with positive voting power that participates in the consensus protocol by broadcasting cryptographic signatures to agree upon the next block. |
| **VSS** | Variable (Verifiable) Secret Sharing -- a cryptographic technique used in MDKM for distributing private key shares. |
| **White Paper** | A guide about a specific topic and the problems that surround it, meant to educate readers. |
