# Developer Overview

Lithosphere is a next-generation Layer 1 blockchain platform designed for cross-chain decentralized applications, privacy-preserving smart contracts, and the LEP100 multi-chain token standard. This overview covers the project structure, packages, design philosophy, and a reading guide for different audiences.

## Monorepo Structure

The Lithosphere codebase is organized as a monorepo managed with pnpm workspaces and Turborepo. The top-level layout is as follows:

```
lithosphere/
├── api/                        # GraphQL API server
├── indexer/                    # Blockchain event indexer
├── contracts/                  # Smart contracts (Solidity)
├── web/                        # Next.js frontend application
├── packages/
│   ├── blockchain-core/        # Core blockchain SDK & utilities
│   ├── create-litho-app/       # CLI tool for scaffolding projects
│   └── docs/                   # Documentation & technical specs
├── clusters/                   # Kubernetes configs (devnet, staging, mainnet)
├── infra/                      # Infrastructure as Code & monitoring
├── scripts/                    # Deployment & utility scripts
└── templates/                  # Project templates for developers
```

Each directory serves a distinct role in the development lifecycle, from smart contract authoring through deployment and monitoring.

## Design Objectives

Lithosphere was built around three core design objectives derived from research on cross-chain technology, AI, machine learning, and decentralization:

### Cross-chain Asset Transfer

- Connect major digital currency networks (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum) and complete asset transactions without altering the original chains' mechanisms.
- Integrate Lithosphere with consortium chains, handling asset transfers in both directions and enabling asset trading on Lithosphere itself.
- Guarantee that cross-chain transactions are secure and that cross-chain transaction services are stable.

### Transaction Privacy Protection

- Allow trading parties to choose whether or not to execute transactions privately.
- Provide privacy protection for digital asset transfers and exchanges.
- Provide holders of digital assets with anonymous protection through ring signatures and one-time accounts.

### Functional Extensibility

- Serve as a decentralized platform for trading non-fungible assets and digital currencies.
- Operate deposit and lending services for multiple digital currencies.
- Enable the creation and exchange of novel digital financial assets.

## Reading Guide

### For Developers

The recommended reading path for developers building on the Lithosphere platform:

1. **Whitepaper** -- Understand the vision and high-level design of the Lithosphere network.
2. **[LEP100 Token Standard](developers/lep100-standard.md)** -- Learn the multi-chain token standard that underpins all Lithosphere tokens.
3. **Architecture Overview** -- Study the architectural decisions, consensus model (LinBFT), and cryptographic primitives (MDKM).
4. **[Smart Contracts](developers/smart-contracts.md)** -- Dive into smart contract development, multi-triggering mechanisms, and DeFi patterns.
5. **[API & SDK](developers/api-and-sdk.md)** -- Integrate with the GraphQL API and blockchain-core SDK.
6. **[CI/CD Guide](developers/ci-cd-guide.md)** -- Configure deployment pipelines across Local, Devnet, Staging, and Mainnet environments.

### For Researchers

- Begin with the **Whitepaper** and the **LEP100 Yellowpaper** for formal specifications.
- Study **Linear Communication BFT (LinBFT)** consensus and its improvements over PBFT.
- Review **Myriad Distributed Key Management (MDKM)** and elliptic curve cryptography primitives.
- Explore **Cross-Chain Integration** for the Lock-in/Lock-out asset mapping model.

### For Investors

- Start with the **Abstract** for the project's mission and positioning.
- Read **Tokenomics** and **Roadmap** sections for network economics and milestones.
- Review **Lithosphere Products** and the **LEP100 Token Standard** for ecosystem understanding.
- Study **Governance** for on-chain decision-making processes.
