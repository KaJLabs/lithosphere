# Lithosphere Algorithmic Cryptocurrency - LAX ⋉

LAX ⋉ is a 𝕃ithosphere ecosystem cryptocurrency with an algorithmically adjusted circulating supply. It is designed to be the base money of the new decentralized economy, by providing an asset that cannot be diluted by supply inflation and remains decoupled to the price action of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC).

LAX ⋉ has a dynamic supply which is determined by supply and demand which ensures it is always worth $1. Unlike coins like U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT) which are backed by audited holdings of U.S. dollars or crypto assets like PAX Gold (PAXG), LAX ⋉ is not pegged to the U.S. dollar or any crypto collateral.

LAX ⋉ can be used for a variety of purposes, such as generating yield, leveraging both the price & yield, providing liquidity and serving as collateral across the Lithosphere ecosystem.
