# MultX infrastructure status

`docker-compose.testnet.yml` and `ansible/deploy-bridge.yml` are historical
Makalu/Kamet deployment references. They are retained for auditability and do
not authorize a LITHO mainnet deployment.

The Compose file binds its public-facing services to loopback, requires an
explicit database password, and disables mock validators by default. Production
secrets must be supplied through the deployment secret manager.

`network.mainnet.template.json` defines the required public deployment fields
without inventing contract addresses. Production API startup requires a
completed copy mounted at an absolute `MULTX_NETWORK_CONFIG_FILE` path. The
loader rejects historical test-chain IDs, missing Ethereum/BNB/Base mainnets,
zero or malformed bridge/token addresses, insecure RPC URLs, bridge mismatches,
and duplicate token routes.

The completed manifest is added only after the audit and mainnet
contract/governance approvals are complete. The template itself cannot pass
the loader and does not authorize deployment.

`docker-compose.mainnet.template.yml` is likewise deliberately non-runnable.
It describes the isolated PostgreSQL/API coordinator, seven independent mTLS
signer connections, loopback-only API binding, read-only container filesystem,
and mounted-file custody boundary. Every `REPLACE_WITH` value must be resolved
from the approved release and secret manager before a canary review.
