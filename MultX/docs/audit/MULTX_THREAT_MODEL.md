## 1. System Overview

MultX is an N-of-M signature bridge between LITHO mainnet (source/canonical
chain, EVM `9005`) and Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Base mainnets. Historical
Kamet/Makalu and external testnet deployments are retained only as test
evidence; their addresses are not production defaults.

### 1.3 Contracts in scope

| Contract | Code lines | Physical lines | Purpose | Storage |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| `MultXBridge.sol` | — | — | Source-chain lock + release (LITHO) | validator/replay state plus independent fixed-window lock and release volumes |
| `MultXBridgeDest.sol` | — | — | Destination-chain lock(burn) + release(mint) | same controls as `MultXBridge`; burns on locks and mints on releases |
| `WrappedLEP100.sol` | — | — | Wrapped representation on destination chains | OZ ERC20 + ERC20Burnable; one immutable bridge minter and no administrator |

### 1.4 Contracts out of scope (don't audit, don't bill)

- `LEP100Token.sol` — canonical LEP100 tokens on Kamet. Already deployed, immutable. Standard ERC20.
- DEX contracts (`contracts/dex/`) — Uniswap v3 fork, separately auditable; not part of bridge surface area.
- DNNS contracts (`contracts/dnns/`) — ENS fork; not part of bridge surface area.
- Faucet contracts — internal-only testnet helper.

## 2. Trust Assumptions

| # | Assumption | What we mitigate / accept |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | Bridge signer key custody is secure | Each signer uses a unique non-exportable AWS KMS `ECC_SECG_P256K1` key. The API and containers hold no validator private keys. A private HTTPS load balancer and a unique bearer token authenticate API-to-signer traffic. Review `MultX/signer/`, `api/src/services/remoteSigner.js`, and `docs/FARGATE_PRODUCTION_SIGNER_CANDIDATE.md`. |
| T2 | At least `signaturesRequired` bridge signers (target: **5 of 7**) act honestly | This is the core security assumption. A quorum can authorize false releases, but every supported production asset must have a positive fixed-window outbound cap. The target set is not active on mainnet yet. |
| T3 | LITHO mainnet itself remains within its BFT safety assumptions | Bridge security inherits chain security. LITHO runs CometBFT consensus with a consensus validator set that is separate from the seven MultX bridge signers. |
| T4 | Source-chain RPC providers return honest state to bridge signers | Every signer queries its configured RPC and verifies the exact event and confirmation depth. Quorum does not provide independence if multiple signers share the same compromised upstream; endpoint/provider diversity must be reviewed before activation. |
| T5 | Compiler (`solc 0.8.24` with optimizer runs=200) is sound | Standard assumption; well-known compiler, widely used. |
| T6 | OpenZeppelin contracts (Pausable, ReentrancyGuard, SafeERC20, ERC20Burnable) are sound | OZ audited and battle-tested. |
| T7 | The owner key (setValidatorSet/setDailyCap/addSupportedToken/unpause) is custodied securely | Target: **owner = TimelockController (48h) governed by an M-of-N Gnosis Safe** (ADR-0004), with a separate fast `pauseGuardian`. Built + tested; live transfer scheduled for production cutover (client decision — see L1). Until then the live owner is the deployer EOA. |

## 3. Adversary Models

### 3.1 Malicious validator subset (size < signaturesRequired)

**Capability:** sign attestations, withhold attestations, sign equivocating attestations.

**Impact:** None directly — under the N-of-M threshold, no minting/release possible. Their signatures contribute to nothing on their own.

**Mitigation:** N-of-M threshold + ordering check (`signer > lastSigner` in `releaseTokens`) prevents the same key being counted twice.

### 3.2 Malicious validator subset (size ≥ signaturesRequired)

**Capability:** sign release of arbitrary amounts of wrapped tokens on destination chains without a corresponding lock on the configured source chain (or vice versa).

**Impact:** Can authorize a false canonical transfer or wrapped-token mint. Each
bridge enforces the configured positive per-token cap on releases in an
independent fixed 24-hour window. This bounds, but does not eliminate, quorum
compromise losses before detection and pause.

`WrappedLEP100` has no administrator or role-grant path. Its single immutable
`bridge` address is the only caller that can mint, eliminating the separate
administrator bypass identified as Autha C-01.

**This is the core trust boundary.** Mitigated only by:
- Validator set composition (independent operators, ideally not all under one legal/operational entity)
- Per-signer KMS/IAM isolation, private endpoint and bearer boundaries,
  DynamoDB anti-equivocation records, and signer-local policy checks make a
  quorum compromise materially harder
- Fixed-window caps (`dailyCap[token]`) independently constrain locks and releases; a boundary burst can approach 2x the configured cap and is included in policy sizing
- Emergency pause — owner can halt all bridge operations within one block of detection

### 3.3 Malicious user / external attacker

**Capability:** call any external function, submit any calldata, replay-attack with old signatures, race-condition exploits.

**Specific attempted attacks and current defenses:**

| Attack | Defense |
|---|---|
| Re-use signed release for the same source-bridge nonce twice | `processedNonces[sourceChain][sourceBridge][sourceNonce]` is set on first execution; subsequent calls for that exact source bridge revert |
| Submit duplicate signatures to inflate count | Signature ordering check: `require(signer > lastSigner, "Signatures must be in ascending order")` |
| Submit signatures from unknown signer | `require(isValidator[signer], "Invalid signer")` |
| Reentrancy on `releaseTokens` (try to recurse during `safeTransfer`) | `nonReentrant` modifier from OZ ReentrancyGuard |
| Lock 0 amount to create spam events | `require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0")` |
| Lock to current chain (no-op bridge) | `require(targetChain != block.chainid)` |
| Bridge unsupported token | `require(supportedTokens[token], "Token not supported")` |
| Bridge an approved token to an unsupported chain | `supportedRoutes[token][targetChain]` must be explicitly enabled by governance; the listener quarantines historical/unmapped events and advances its durable cursor |
| Admit fee-on-transfer or rebasing semantics | Source escrow verifies its exact post-transfer balance delta; asset policy separately prohibits rebasing, reflection, callback-bearing and other non-standard balance behavior |
| Exceed lock or release cap | Per-token fixed 24h windows separately enforce `dailyVolume + amount <= dailyCap` and `releaseVolume + amount <= dailyCap` |
| Front-run or malleate an in-flight signature submission | Signatures bind `(sourceTxHash, sourceBridge, token, user, amount, sourceChain, sourceNonce, destinationChain, destinationBridge)`; OpenZeppelin ECDSA rejects non-canonical high-s signatures, and only the bound recipient receives funds |
| Burst across a cap-window boundary | Explicitly accepted fixed-window behavior; policy must size caps for a potential near-2x boundary burst and monitoring must alert before exhaustion |

### 3.4 Malicious bridge owner

**Capability:** pause bridge, change validator set, raise/lower caps, add/remove tokens.

**Impact:** Can halt all bridge operations (pause), can replace validators with attacker-controlled keys (then drain via T2.2), can raise daily caps to enable a single-day drain.

**Mitigation:** owner becomes a Safe→Timelock(48h) at production cutover; guardian (pause-only) already in code. Currently a single deployer key on the live bridge — **see L1 below** (mitigation built, transfer deferred to production per client).

### 3.5 Compromised RPC provider used by validator service

**Capability:** lie to a single validator about chain state.

**Impact:** that validator either signs an invalid attestation (caught by other validators refusing) or fails to sign valid attestations (degrades signing throughput but doesn't break safety).

**Mitigation:** each signer verifies state using its configured RPC. Production
approval must record provider/endpoint diversity so one compromised upstream
cannot supply identical false state to a quorum. Audit firm: please assess the
minimum acceptable diversity and failure policy.

---

## 4. Asset Flow Invariants

For each LEP100 token `T` and each chain pair (LITHO source, destination):

1. **Conservation (steady state):**
   ```
   sum(T balance of LITHO bridge) >= sum(T minted on dest) - sum(T burned on dest)
   ```
   Or in plain terms: tokens locked on LITHO must always cover tokens currently
   minted on the destination chain. If users have wrapped tokens on a
   destination chain, the original tokens on LITHO should be held by the bridge
   contract.

2. **Nonce monotonicity:** `nonce` strictly increases per chain. `processedNonces[srcChain][srcNonce]` is one-way (false → true, never reverted).

3. **Signature attribution:** every release event is attributable to exactly the validators whose signatures the call provided.

4. **No partial reverts:** all state changes in `lockTokens` and `releaseTokens` either fully apply or fully revert (covered by ReentrancyGuard + Solidity's atomicity).

5. **Pausable atomicity:** `pause()` blocks any new `lockTokens` / `releaseTokens` until `unpause()`. Already in-flight transactions on chain still complete (no force-revert), but no NEW txs can be initiated.

### Invariant testing recommendation

Audit firm: please test these with Foundry / Echidna invariant tests. Suggested invariants for the testing harness:

```solidity
// Echidna-style invariants
function invariant_no_double_release() public view {
  for (each sourceChain, sourceBridge, sourceNonce) {
    assert(processedNonces[sourceChain][sourceBridge][sourceNonce] == true || release_for_that_nonce_count == 0);
  }
}

function invariant_signer_ordering() public {
  // Crafted release with duplicate sig should always revert
}

function invariant_pause_blocks_lock() public {
  pause();
  vm.expectRevert();
  lockTokens(...);
}
```

## 5. Known Limitations (accepted for v1 — flagged for audit attention)

| # | Limitation | Why accepted for v1 | Plan for v2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | Owner is a single EOA, not a multisig — **MITIGATION BUILT, transfer deferred to production** | The Safe + TimelockController(48h) + guardian design is implemented and tested (`Governance.integration.test.js`), and the migration tooling is ready. Per client decision (2026-06-20), the **live** Kamet bridge stays under the deployer EOA through audit/testnet (test wallets used for rehearsal); ownership is transferred to the client-held M-of-N Safe at production cutover (M4.6). See ADR-0004 + `docs/operations/GOVERNANCE_MIGRATION.md`. | Execute live ownership transfer at production cutover |
| L2 | No economic slashing of misbehaving validators | Out of scope for v1; bridge can rotate via `setValidatorSet` instead | Optional: stake LITHO via separate contract that can slash on equivocation proof |
| L3 | Validator service uses one signature coordinator (`MultX/api`), not a P2P mesh | The coordinator cannot forge signatures and each signer independently validates the source event, confirmations, bridge and route. A coordinator outage can halt transfers, but cannot satisfy the quorum. | Add redundant coordinators or P2P aggregation if availability requires it |
| L4 | Cross-destination replay — **resolved in audit candidate** | The signed hash now includes `block.chainid` and `address(this)`. Signer policies also bind the release bridge. Contract, API and signer tests reject reuse on a different chain/bridge. Independent audit confirmation remains required. |
| L5 | Caps use fixed 24-hour windows, not rolling windows | Boundary behavior can allow nearly 2x the nominal cap in a short interval; this is documented and must be included in approved cap sizing | A future rolling-bucket implementation may reduce burst allowance |
| L6 | Pause guardian == owner — **RESOLVED in code** | Dedicated `pauseGuardian` role added: a fast ops key can `pause()` without holding owner rights; `unpause()`/config stay owner-only. Proven in `contracts/test/Governance.integration.test.js`. The live `pauseGuardian` is assigned during the governance wiring at production cutover (address(0) until then → pause is owner-only, as today). | Assign guardian at cutover |
| L7 | No on-chain `setSignaturesRequired` independent of `setValidatorSet` | `setValidatorSet` always takes both; intentional to prevent inconsistent state | None |

---

## 6. Out-of-scope items the audit shouldn't bill for

To keep the audit scoped tightly and the fee predictable:

- **Uniswap v3 fork** in `contracts/dex/` — separate audit scope if/when needed
- **ENS fork (DNNS)** in `contracts/dnns/` — separate audit scope if/when needed
- **Faucet** scripts and contracts — testnet helper only, doesn't hold mainnet funds
- **Indexer + bridge-api business logic** in `bridge-api/` — not on-chain code; assess via separate ops security review
- **Validator signer infrastructure** (AWS account, VPC/ALB, ECS, IAM,
  Secrets Manager and monitoring configuration) — separate cloud-operations
  review; the signing protocol itself still requires application-security
  review
- **Frontend** (`kamet-explorer`) — not security-critical; users can always interact directly with the contract

---

## 7. Open questions for the audit firm

We'd like the audit to specifically opine on:

1. **Signature scheme:** confirm that the EIP-191 hash, now explicitly bound to destination `block.chainid` and `address(this)`, plus ordered-signer enforcement is robust against malleability and cross-domain replay. Advise whether EIP-712 is still required.
2. **Cap semantics:** confirm the documented fixed-window boundary behavior and
   the independent outbound release limiter adequately address M-04.
3. **Pause behavior on `releaseTokens`:** if a release is mid-execution when pause is called, does it complete? Should it?
4. **Validator set rotation:** when `setValidatorSet` is called, any release tx not yet executed will reject signatures from the old set. Is this the desired behavior, or should there be a grace period? Recommend documenting this in operator runbook.
5. **Dest-chain wrapped token (`WrappedLEP100`):** confirm its immutable bridge-only mint authority closes C-01 without introducing a new administrator path.

## 8. Deployment & operational context

### Current deployment (Kamet testnet — mainnet launch pending this audit)

- Contract: `0x3a896BDF3a1088287FA84aB5a43bB30e2535F263` (live on Kamet, chainId 900523, **testnet**)
- Deployed: 2026-05-09 (hardened version with Pausable, setValidatorSet, daily caps)
- Owner: deployer EOA `0x10ed4F004Fe708014ae27Bcc20c9Ed9df3f4eadF` (unchanged). The Safe + Timelock(48h) + guardian migration is built and tested; per client decision (2026-06-20) the live ownership transfer to the client-held M-of-N Safe happens at **production cutover** — test wallets are used for any pre-production rehearsal. The guarded contract (with `pauseGuardian`) is what the audit reviews and what deploys at cutover.
- Validators (7, **5-of-7 threshold**, migrated 2026-05-19 via atomic pause -> setValidatorSet -> unpause; no in-flight tx affected):
  - `#0 0xD9B30A7f4d58f1b98AaA69B82F0c8bF0816638FB`
  - `#1 0xEefB2E0c91Bc57975D117BADA6c70f3Cd6C4bC91`
  - `#2 0x4dFEd8e8359EaA711CdFFFcb5d994a66e46185Ac`
  - `#3 0x27026F8C232d723100700186c10B2aEbd82ea60C`
  - `#4 0xc8C5c89ddb70CAEC942f2C5A77F4F4001ef3B415`
  - `#5 0x4CDd6D160Bd79fe7d4Bab06a9E0607870e8108D9`
  - `#6 0xB161611185Ce2c95849134188AC9F5DbC26bfD2D`
- Validator keys: the LITHO mainnet candidate uses seven isolated AWS Fargate
  services with one non-exportable KMS key and DynamoDB decision table per
  signer. Production rejects file-backed keys. Release signing remains
  disabled and no LITHO mainnet signer set is active on chain yet.

### Operational runbooks supplied to audit firm
