# Consensus Mechanism

Lithosphere adapts a proof of stake consensus mechanism.

The goal of Lithosphere is to use blockchain technology to build an infrastructure platform to run decentralized applications and on the platform, multiple types of tokens will be able to freely interact through smart contracts to achieve value interoperability. Lithosphere aims to implement Myriad Distributed Key Management to build smart contracts for DeFi.

When an unregistered asset is moved from the originating chain to Lithosphere, Lithosphere will construct a new asset based on the cross-chain transaction information, utilizing a built-in asset template to deploy a new smart contract. When a registered asset is moved from the original chain to Lithosphere, Lithosphere will issue equal tokens in existing contracts, ensuring that the original chain assets may still be traded on Lithosphere.
