Litho is the native coin of Lithosphere. Both cross-and intra-chain transactions consume a certain amount of Litho. Litho is also used in security deposits for the cross-chain verification nodes. Litho / $LITHO is the currency of choice in the Lithosphere network although another crypto can be used as well since the Lithosphere blockchain supports interoperability.
