# Funding for the project

The initial distribution of litho coin and validators on Kamet (the first version of Lithosphere network) will go to the donors of the Lithosphere Fundraiser (70%), lead donors (5%), KaJ Labs Foundation (10%), network awareness (10%) and the core team members (10%). From Kamet onward, 1/3 of the total amount of $Litho will be rewarded to bonded validators and delegators every year.\
One of the vaults / Capsules in the Lithosphere will be set up to hold marketing/awareness funds.
