# Project promotion method

The concept separates community operations into two categories: core and periphery. The former prefers the offline mode, whilst the latter prefers the internet mode. The following is the strategy for key community operations:

* Lithosphere Foundation team: the team will be rewarded with tokens. One reason is to compensate for the resources used in the previous time, and the other is to allow anybody to become a shareholder and expect them to contribute to Lithosphere in the future.
* Community for blockchain technology.
* Technology is both the most important and the most difficult aspect of blockchain development. We will utilize online and offline methods to discover and nurture a group of top-tier talents to promote the technological community, using the founding teamâ€™s technical expertise and social resources.
* Blockchain value community: Using the blockchain technology community, we can organize gatherings with holders to disseminate blockchain knowledge while also promoting opportunities for collaboration with the private value community.
