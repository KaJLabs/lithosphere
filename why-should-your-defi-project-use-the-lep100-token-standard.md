# Why should your DeFi project use the LEP100 Token Standard?

LEP100 tokens may be used to represent a variety of assets, including stocks, fiat currency, and crypto-assets. Other tokens from various blockchains may easily be pegged to the LEP100 token. As a result, it enables developers to construct different versions of crypto assets using the same tokens.

All validators that transfer the LEP100 token will receive LITHO as a reward. The incentive is paid out in the form of a transaction charge. When compared to other token standards such as ERC20, it has minimal gas prices for all transactions. It’s built on the Lithosphere network, which offers fast transaction speeds of more than 100,000-1m TPS compared to Ethereum’s ERC20’s 15 TPS and Bitcoin’s 4 TPS.

Integrating DeFI projects with LEP100 tokens is simple. You may also list items for free on DEX such as LithoSwap, PancakeSwap, and Uniswap
