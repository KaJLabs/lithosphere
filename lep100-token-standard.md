# LEP100 Token Standard

LEP100 specifications are followed by all Lithosphere tokens. The Lithosphere network is a multi-chain architecture that allows anybody to develop dApps and other blockchain-based digital assets. It also ensures cross-chain trade, minimal gas consumption, and quick transactions with safe transactions.

LEP100 makes it possible for tokens on the Lithosphere blockchain to function properly. As a consequence, everyone benefits from low transaction fees.

Furthermore, regardless of the blockchain networkâ€™s structure, the cross-chain DeFI mechanism improves the interoperability of all tiny contracts. The Lithosphere environment is highly supportive, and the Litho Launchpad finances all bootstraps with various DeFI programs.
