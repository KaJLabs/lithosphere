# Verification Nodes

To earn a portion of the transaction fees, a Validator completes the recording of transactions on Lithosphere. According to the stake it owns, a Validator receives a corresponding key share and calculates the associated signature share to be appended to the transaction. According to the key share percentage, the Validator gets the transaction fee associated with the verification transaction. The transaction fee cannot be collected if the key sharing information is unavailable or lost. If the nodes sign the incorrect transaction, the Validator’s credentials will be removed as well.

In summary, the verification node incentive system will encourage Authenticators to give proper transaction proof, Validators to faithfully finish Lithosphere recording, and Record-keepers to stay online and keep their key shares secure.

Verification nodes are only available to individuals with a large enough stake in the Lithosphere network. General nodes are nodes that do not qualify as verification nodes. The general nodes are unable to participate in the cross-chain transaction verification process, but they can commit their stakes to the trusted verification nodes. The transaction fees received by the entrusted verification nodes are distributed to the general nodes in proportion to the entrusted stakes. General nodes will suffer a comparable loss if the delegated verification node is penalized.

Stakeholders in Lithosphere can gain stake-related advantages while also being motivated to commit their stakes to trusted verification nodes thanks to this incentive mechanism. This enhances Lithosphere’s security and stability.
