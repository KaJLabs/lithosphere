# Enhancements and compatibility

Based on Ethereum and other blockchain smart contracts, Lithosphereâ€™s smart contract will be upgraded and developed. Functionality additions, such as triggering mechanisms, will be added depending on compatibility with existing smart contracts. Smart contracts already operating on Ethereum and other blockchains will be able to simply move to Lithosphere, and smart contract developers will be able to swiftly create on Lithosphere.

The next step will be to optimize programming languages and virtual machines for a more robust application development environment, as well as to provide more intuitive application development tools and debug environments for developers with less coding knowledge.
