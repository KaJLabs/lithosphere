# Cryptography Based Security Guarantee

Many existing cross-chain trades employ logical security mechanisms, which rely on participants to watch out for their self-interest. To put it another way, players will not disrupt cross-chain transactions if it means harming their interests. This is known as “The Rational Participants Hypothesis.” Lithosphere employs threshold secret-sharing technology, as well as original elliptic curve cryptography, to assure the security of the original signature solution.

The multi-party computing-based locked account management solution;

The ring signatures and one-time accounts-based privacy protection method for smart contract token transactions.

After beginning a cross-chain transaction, all following actions are performed automatically between Lithosphere validator nodes and do not require coordination from transaction participants. This leaves the security of cryptographic methods to ensure the system’s seamless operation.
