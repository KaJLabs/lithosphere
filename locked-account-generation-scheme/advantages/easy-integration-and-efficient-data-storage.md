# Easy Integration and Efficient Data Storage

The initial transaction of the original chain is used to perform any operation on the Locked Account. There are no new transaction types or verification mechanisms. As a result, any chain may theoretically be merged with Lithosphere at a low cost. At the same time, unlike the multi-signature account scheme, which uses smart contract logic to accomplish multiparty management, the Locked Account creation strategy uses cryptographic principles to achieve multiparty management. There is just one signature on the final transaction, not multiple. As a result, this technique is more data storage efficient.
