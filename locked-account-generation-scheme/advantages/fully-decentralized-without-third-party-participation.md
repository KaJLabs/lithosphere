# Fully Decentralized without Third-Party Participation

Secure multi-party computation is used to produce the Locked Account. A trustworthy third- participation party or endorsement is not required in this procedure. All we need is secure routes for information exchange and computation by Validators. The Locked Account generation technique is less expensive and more flexible than the trusted third-party escrow account scheme.
