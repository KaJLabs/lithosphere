# Secure and stable

Shamir’s Secret Sharing Scheme (a.k.a. Shamir’s (k, n)-threshold secret sharing scheme) is used to distribute the key for the Locked Account to Lithosphere validators. One component of the key share is held by each Validator. Even if several Validators go offline or lose their key shares, the Locked Account’s signature can still be produced, and the trans-action can still be completed with at least k validators. As a result, the creation strategy for Locked Accounts can assure that.
