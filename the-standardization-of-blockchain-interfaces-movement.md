# The Standardization of Blockchain Interfaces Movement

The Internet of Value has interoperability and scalability problems that require many parties to address. The Lithosphere project is inextricably linked to these two obstacles’ breakthrough development and advancement. By establishing the “Blockchain Interface Standardization Movement,” we will help to enhance them. For the Lithosphere Foundation, this will be a long-term project.

The movement will encourage standardization of interfaces not just between blockchains, but also between decentralized and centralized organizations, as well as between blockchains and external data sources.
