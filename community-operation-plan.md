# Community operation plan

The KaJ Labs Foundation, as the project’s main sponsor, is aiming towards a promising blockchain ecosystem rather than corporate profitability as typical enterprise and startup initiatives do. The Lithosphere platform, which benefits all token holders, is not owned by any single entity or person. The whole blockchain token community owns the Lithosphere platform. Lithosphere makes token usage more flexible and accessible, as well as giving tokens the potential to offer sophisticated DeFi services. The value of all tokens will increase.

In reality, the Internet of Value’ cross-chain ecosystem is a massive project. The Kaj Labs Foundation must progress the ecosystem, which must be joined and participated in by the whole community, and whose blockchain must be enhanced via continual iteration. This is exactly what the features of a blockchain project are. Blockchain initiatives begin with a critical need or problem to be addressed, which must be continually investigated by participants and those in need to encourage continuous progress. At the same time, it will draw more individuals into the community, causing demand to shift the projects in a better direction and encourage the advancement of its technology. The purpose of the echoes is to generate a positive feedback loop of incentives, applications, and usage. As a result, project operations concepts must be community-oriented from the start, and community operations are linked to the success or failure of the blockchain project.

The following people make up the community:

* The Core development team and the Kaj Labs Foundation. They are the project’s platform’s sponsors and facilitators.
* Programmers who want to be a part of the project. They can join the Foundation development team or independently create and optimize Lithosphere as a third party if they are interested in projects or project technologies.
* Participating nodes in the Lithosphere They make money by keeping track of ledgers and operating smart contracts while also maintaining Lithosphere.
* Users of the Lithosphere platform. For DeFi and other services, they employ the Lithosphere platform.&#x20;
* On the Lithosphere platform, DeFi service providers such as payment institutes, centralized or decentralized exchanges, lending institutes, and other financial service providers.
* Lithosphere token holders, such as private equity companies, early-stage investors, late-stage investors, and potential investors.
* Other parties involved in the development of Lithosphere, such as the media, government, and so on.
* The goal of community operations is to gather as much force as possible and arrange it in the most efficient way possible so that Lithosphere can iterate, improve, influence, and serve a wider community.

The growth of the community is inextricably linked to both the core and outlying communities. The two are mutually beneficial, with the core community serving as the focal point. The peripheral community, on the other hand, must continue to participate in the creation of the key community since the core community will originate from and borrow from the peripheral community, and the peripheral community will require the core community’s resources to support them. We discovered that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other projects have all grown in the same way. The core community consists of early adopters, blockchain technology communities, and blockchain value communities, while peripheral resources include additional investors, users, developers, journalists, and other interested parties.
